         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHat were the grounds and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements that moved us to ſeize on the Governour and other principall Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Government under King <hi>James,</hi> and that we unanimouſly declared for the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> ſhall not need here to be mentioned, I'm ſure our Intention was never to depart from our Loyalty &amp; Allegiance to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which now ſince it hath pleaſed God to place on the Heads of our Soveraign Lord and Lady, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who are owned &amp; proclaimed as ſuch thro'out all their Majeſties Kingdomes, Territories &amp; Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and perticularly by us; we are the more firmly obleiged to teſtify and bear Obedience to them in the beſt and moſt dutifull manner we can.</p>
            <p>And therefore tho' upon misinformations or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken notions of things, we have for ſometime ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many inconveniencies (which have produced great loſſe and dammage to our Countrey and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) in hopes of ſome Directions from <hi>England</hi> for our firmer Settlement, yet ſince thoſe hopes by the Circumſtances of Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto fail'd us; &amp; many things have by our ſearch and enquiry into matters of the Government and actions of ſeveral perſons, appear'd to us much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than they were repreſented, and ſince tho' we have had in our hands and keeping all publique papers, and acquainted our ſelves with the Letters and Correſpondency which thoſe in Office and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had, both at home and in forreign parts; we cannot finde any grounds to charge the Plott or Deſigne on them of indeavouring to ſell the Country, or procure any Violence to be done to, or acted upon the Inhabitants as was ſuggeſted: It is highly neceſſary and propper for us (not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our paſt actions which ſpeedy Amendment may the eaſier paſſe by) to conſider in what ſtate and condition we now ſtand with reſpect to our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; Allegiance to the King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> as becometh good Chriſtians and loyall Subjects; and therein theſe two things offer themſelves prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for our Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is required of us by our Allegiance, and whether there be not a lawfull Authority, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons well &amp; ſufficiently authorized from that crown to rule &amp; govern us, and whom we ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, aſſiſt and obey, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether the ſeeming Government now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on us be any wayes lawfull, or ſuch as with our Allegiance and a good Conſcience we ought to yeild obedience to, or whether it be not in the law meer uſurpation and tyranny.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place we muſt know that it is required of us by our Allegiance, that we bear a true and faithful obedience and ſubjection to our Soveraign, This obedience is an incident inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to every Subject; for as ſoon as he is born he oweth by birth right Legiance and obedience to his Soveraign. <hi>Ligeantia est vinculum fidei.</hi> As the ligatures or ſtrings do knit together the joints of all parts of the body, ſo doth Legiance join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soveraign and all his ſubjects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubjects are bound to obey their Soveraign, and he is called their Leige Lord, becauſe he ſhould maintain and defend them.</p>
            <p>We are not only to ſubmit and yield obedience to the King as Supream, but unto Governours as them that are ſent by him, and unto all other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Miniſters lawfully placed in Authority under him.</p>
            <p>It is very well known to us all that Sr. <hi>Edmond Andros</hi> is a Governour ſent by the King, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Authourized by Letters Patents under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to exerciſe authority and Government over us in this their Majeſties Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Dominion of <hi>New-England.</hi> And we muſt alſo know for a certain truth, That that power and authority given to him, cannot determine or be ſuperſeded by the Death or Removall of the late King <hi>James,</hi> but by their Majeſties expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Grant of the Government by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents to ſome other perſon. And tho' force and violence may reſtrain and hinder his perſon from the Diſcharge of his duty, yet the power and authority veſted in him is not thereby leſſened or diminiſhed; tis we are onely wanting in our duty and Allegiance, and ſo far put our ſelves out of the Kings protection as we deny or refuſe the means or authority he has appointed for the ſame.</p>
            <p>The King in his politicall Capacity never dyes. Therefore is there no time when it can be ſaid there is no King, the inconveniency would be too great if it were, and we never know the Death or Removall of one but by the proclaiming of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then our Allegiance becomes due to him that is ſeated on the Throne: and ſo it is with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and other Officers in Government as well as private ſubjects. Their Allegiance and Duty is transferr'd to the Succeſſour as well as ours, and they become ſervants of him who ſits on the throne, and want no new orders or authority to maintaine the Government comimtted to their Charge under the Succeſſor, as well as under that prince who gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the powers, for it muſt never be admitted that any place or people can be without Government by Reaſon of the ſucceſſion of the Supream.</p>
            <p>It is he then only that is veſted with lawfull Power from our Soveraign, him therefore we ought in duty and conſcience to obey, and all Officers and Miniſters authorized under him: for they are not his but the Kings Officers and miniſters, the King being the Head of the Government, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour onely his chief Officer or miniſter here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
<pb facs="tcp:184833:2" rendition="simple:additions"/> and authorized to act in their Majeſties name and behalfe, and this we muſt do if we either regard Loyalty or Conſcience, which out of Love to you all, cannot forbear to preſſe and move you to.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, the ſeeming Government now impoſed upon us, as it hath no foundation or Authority, ſo cannot be able to ſupport it ſelf: and if we indeavour by force and Violence to keep it up, we both wrong our conſciences before God, and make our ſelves criminall to our Soveraign in the higheſt nature, and at once diveſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties of the Chiefeſt Jewell of their Crown, which is Power, they having the command of all their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rule and govern, and not they them. Beſides, another great mark of <note place="margin">Shep. grand Abridgem't.</note> their Soveraignty, is Omnipreſence, for they are preſent in all their Courts and with all their Officers and Miniſters in their Offices, and therefore any abuſe or contempt offered to them is done to the King and Queen, in reſpect of the Authority they are clothed with.</p>
            <p>The Pretence of power to govern by vertue of the Charter granted to the late Governour &amp; Company of the Maſſachuſets Bay in <hi>N. England,</hi> is moſt weak &amp; groundleſſe, for that Charter was ſeverall years ſince by due Courſe of Law in the Kings Courts at Weſtminſter, Condemn'd, made Null, and Cancell'd, and on an Exemplification of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt it under the broad Seal of <hi>England</hi> and power of Government given to a Preſident and Councill, <hi>Anno</hi> 1686. The then Governour and Company layd down the Government and left it to the Preſident and Councill who took upon them the Government accordingly: by vertue whereof the body politick of that Corporation was diſſolv'd, and the Succeſſion determined. And there is no poſſibility by law for any that were formerly Members of that Corporation, to take upon them that Government, untill they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain lawfully eſtabliſhed into their former politicall Capacity, which they cannot be, without their Majeſties new Grant, and ſo are now in no other capcity but as private perſons; and as ſuch to take upon them the Government, and to make Rates and Taxes upon the people, is but meer Urſurpation and Tyranny, which none ought to ſubmit to or obey but declare and proteſt againſt and indeavour to apprehend and ſecure the Actors as the greateſt Traitors and Criminalls to their Majeſtyes and Countrey.</p>
            <p>The Vote or Conſent of Ten Thouſand tho it may give greater force and Violence, yet gives no more right or power in Law than the Vote or Conſent of one private perſon; and therefore there can be no colour of Authority for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but ſuch as is lawfully derived from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream head.</p>
            <p>Tis not too late to think of theſe things, for we have ſuffered enough already for want of being in the right way and haveing a lawful power over us. If anything in the Governours Commiſſion ſeem to abſolute, or that which we underſtand not well, or that poſſibly may be amiſs, it is not our intereſts to condemn the Whole for that for doubtleſſe the power of Government is in the King and Queen onely, and all inferiour Officers and Miniſters ought to be appointed by them, therefore we muſt not lay them all aſide at once and leave our ſelves without any Authority or Government. The worſt Government is better than none; and we had better ſupport that which hath real Authority, and may help to protect us, than that which is only imaginary, without any Authority, and can onely hurt and inſnare us, and bring miſeries on ourſelves and poſterity.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things are well worth our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeaſonably; and if well Reſolv'd and put in practiſe may help to gloſſe and excuſe any paſt miſtaken Actions, ſave our Country from further ſpoil &amp; Deſolation, and in great meaſure regaine our good names and Credit abroad, and put us and our Neighbors into a firm Unity whereby we may be enabled not onely to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves againſt the <hi>French,</hi> but to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy them, of which never was greater need than at this Time, when our Weakneſſe in Government and Diviſions expoſe us to imminent Danger incaſe of an Attack, as we heare hath been allready made on other of their Majeſties Dominions.</p>
            <p>I have no other end herein than to bring you into the wayes of God &amp; Peace; to which, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to lawfull Government &amp; Authority, I'me ſure is a principal ſtep, and which, in my Opinion (conſidering the face of things in Europe, and the lateſt News we have from our friends there) can onely give preſent Eaſe to our injured &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Countrey.</p>
